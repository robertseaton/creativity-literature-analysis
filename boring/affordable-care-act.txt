For purposes of this paragraph, the cost of cov- erage shall be determined based on the total amount of employer and employee contributions for the benefit pack- age under which the employee is (or the employee and any dependents are) receiving coverage. A reward may be in the form of a discount or rebate of a premium or contribu- tion, a waiver of all or part of a cost-sharing mechanism (such as deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance), the ab- sence of a surcharge, or the value of a benefit that would otherwise not be provided under the plan.

‘‘(B) The wellness program shall be reasonably de- signed to promote health or prevent disease. A program complies with the preceding sentence if the program has a reasonable chance of improving the health of, or pre- venting disease in, participating individuals and it is not overly burdensome, is not a subterfuge for discriminating based on a health status factor, and is not highly suspect in the method chosen to promote health or prevent disease.
‘‘(C) The plan shall give individuals eligible for the program the opportunity to qualify for the reward under the program at least once each year.
‘‘(D) The full reward under the wellness program shall be made available to all similarly situated individuals. For such purpose, among other things:
‘‘(i) The reward is not available to all similarly sit- uated individuals for a period unless the wellness pro- gram allows—

‘‘(II) for a reasonable alternative standard (or waiver of the otherwise applicable standard) for obtaining the reward for any individual for whom, for that period, it is medically inadvisable to at- tempt to satisfy the otherwise applicable stand- ard.
‘‘(ii) If reasonable under the circumstances, the
plan or issuer may seek verification, such as a state- ment from an individual’s physician, that a health sta- tus factor makes it unreasonably difficult or medically inadvisable for the individual to satisfy or attempt to satisfy the otherwise applicable standard.

Subtitle F—Shared Responsibility for Health Care
PART I—INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY
SEC. 1501 ø42 U.S.C. 18091¿. REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM ES- SENTIAL COVERAGE.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following findings:
(1) IN GENERAL.—The individual responsibility require- ment provided for in this section (in this subsection referred to as the ‘‘requirement’’) is commercial and economic in nature, and substantially affects interstate commerce, as a result of
the effects described in paragraph (2).
(2) EFFECTS ON THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND INTERSTATE
COMMERCE.—øReplaced by section 10106(a)¿ The effects de- scribed in this paragraph are the following:
(A) The requirement regulates activity that is commer- cial and economic in nature: economic and financial deci- sions about how and when health care is paid for, and when health insurance is purchased. In the absence of the requirement, some individuals would make an economic and financial decision to forego health insurance coverage and attempt to self-insure, which increases financial risks to households and medical providers.
(B) Health insurance and health care services are a significant part of the national economy. National health spending is projected to increase from $2,500,000,000,000, or 17.6 percent of the economy, in 2009 to $4,700,000,000,000 in 2019. Private health insurance spending is projected to be $854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for medical supplies, drugs, and equipment that are shipped in interstate commerce. Since most health insur- ance is sold by national or regional health insurance com- panies, health insurance is sold in interstate commerce and claims payments flow through interstate commerce.

PPACA (Consolidated) 144
(C) The requirement, together with the other provi- sions of this Act, will add millions of new consumers to the health insurance market, increasing the supply of, and de- mand for, health care services, and will increase the num- ber and share of Americans who are insured.
(D) The requirement achieves near-universal coverage by building upon and strengthening the private employer- based health insurance system, which covers 176,000,000 Americans nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar re- quirement has strengthened private employer-based cov- erage: despite the economic downturn, the number of workers offered employer-based coverage has actually in- creased.
(E) The economy loses up to $207,000,000,000 a year because of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the uninsured. By significantly reducing the number of the un- insured, the requirement, together with the other provi- sions of this Act, will significantly reduce this economic cost.
(F) The cost of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured was $43,000,000,000 in 2008. To pay for this cost, health care providers pass on the cost to private in- surers, which pass on the cost to families. This cost-shift- ing increases family premiums by on average over $1,000 a year. By significantly reducing the number of the unin- sured, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will lower health insurance premiums.
(G) 62 percent of all personal bankruptcies are caused in part by medical expenses. By significantly increasing health insurance coverage, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will improve financial se- curity for families.
(H) Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and this Act, the Fed- eral Government has a significant role in regulating health insurance. The requirement is an essential part of this larger regulation of economic activity, and the absence of the requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market.
(I) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Health Service Act (as added by section 1201 of this Act), if there were no requirement, many individuals would wait to pur- chase health insurance until they needed care. By signifi- cantly increasing health insurance coverage, the require- ment, together with the other provisions of this Act, will minimize this adverse selection and broaden the health in- surance risk pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is es- sential to creating effective health insurance markets in which improved health insurance products that are guar- anteed issue and do not exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold.

(J) Administrative costs for private health insurance, which were $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 30 percent of premiums in the current individual and small group markets. By significantly increasing health insurance cov- erage and the size of purchasing pools, which will increase economies of scale, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will significantly reduce ad- ministrative costs and lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating effective health insurance markets that do not require underwriting and eliminate its associated administrative costs.
(3) SUPREME COURT RULING.—In United States v. South-
Eastern Underwriters Association (322 U.S. 533 (1944)), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that insurance is interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation.
(b) IN GENERAL.—Subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code of
￼1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new chapter:
‘‘CHAPTER 48—MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE

SEC. 2405. FUNDING TO EXPAND STATE AGING AND DISABILITY RE- SOURCE CENTERS.
Out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, there is appropriated to the Secretary of Health and Human Serv- ices, acting through the Assistant Secretary for Aging, $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2014, to carry out subsections (a)(20)(B)(iii) and (b)(8) of section 202 of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3012).
SEC. 2406. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LONG-TERM CARE.
(a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the following findings:
(1) Nearly 2 decades have passed since Congress seriously considered long-term care reform. The United States Bipar- tisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, also know as the ‘‘Pepper Commission’’, released its ‘‘Call for Action’’ blueprint for health reform in September 1990. In the 20 years since those recommendations were made, Congress has never
acted on the report.
(2) In 1999, under the United States Supreme Court’s deci-
sion in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), individuals with disabilities have the right to choose to receive their long-term services and supports in the community, rather than in an in- stitutional setting.
(3) Despite the Pepper Commission and Olmstead decision, the long-term care provided to our Nation’s elderly and dis- abled has not improved. In fact, for many, it has gotten far worse.

(4) In 2007, 69 percent of Medicaid long-term care spend- ing for elderly individuals and adults with physical disabilities paid for institutional services. Only 6 states spent 50 percent or more of their Medicaid long-term care dollars on home and community-based services for elderly individuals and adults with physical disabilities while 1⁄2 of the States spent less than 25 percent. This disparity continues even though, on average, it is estimated that Medicaid dollars can support nearly 3 el- derly individuals and adults with physical disabilities in home and community-based services for every individual in a nurs- ing home. Although every State has chosen to provide certain services under home and community-based waivers, these serv- ices are unevenly available within and across States, and reach a small percentage of eligible individuals.
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense of the Senate that—
(1) during the 111th session of Congress, Congress should address long-term services and supports in a comprehensive way that guarantees elderly and disabled individuals the care they need; and
(2) long term services and supports should be made avail- able in the community in addition to in institutions.
